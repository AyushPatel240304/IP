<h2 style="font-size: 30px;"><u><center>Energy Conservation</center></u></h2>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orangered;">Energy conservation is the effort made to reduce the consumption of energy by using less of an energy service. <br>This can be achieved either by using energy more efficiently (using less energy for a constant service) or by reducing the amount of service used (for example, by driving less). <br>Energy conservation is a part of the concept of Eco-sufficiency. <br>Energy conservation measures (ECMs) in buildings reduce the need for energy services and can result in increased environmental quality, national security, personal financial security and higher savings. <br>It is at the top of the sustainable energy hierarchy. <br>It also lowers energy costs by preventing future resource depletion.</p>
