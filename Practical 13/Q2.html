	<li>
	<p class="p1"><b>Always being on call</b><br>
	Parents don’t punch a time clock; they are always on duty.<br> Even when a child is grown and living on his or her own, a parent’s job is never done.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p><b>Teaching life skills</b><br>
	One day, your child will leave the nest. A parent’s job in raising a child is to prepare the child for that day.

	In most cases, if something is important to your child, even if you don’t understand why, it is important that your child has your full, unquestioning support.
