<h1 id="c1">What is CSS?</h1>
<p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. In short, CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics. HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style sheet language. Think “look and feel” when you think CSS.</p>
<h1 id="c1">How Does CSS Work with HTML?</h1>
<p>If HTML were the engine components of a car, CSS would be the body style and the paint job. A website can run without CSS, but it certainly isn’t pretty. CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.</p>
<h1 id="c1">Why Is CSS so important?</h1>
<p>CSS is important because it controls all design-related aspects of your website. Typography, colours, page layouts and any other visual aspects of your website are all controlled by CSS.<br>What's more, CSS allows you to control and adjust the design and formatting of your entire website (no matter how big or small it is) from a single spot. This is done using what's called an external style sheet.</p>
