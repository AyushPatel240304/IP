<h2><u>WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT FOR MOBILE DEVICES</u></h2>
<p><span id="out">Responsive Web Design</span> is a term for a set of techniques that enables your web site to adapt its layout as its viewing environment — most obviously, the size and orientation of the screen — changes. It includes techniques such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>fluid CSS layouts, to make the page adapt smoothly as the browser window size changes</li>
<li>the use of media queries to conditionally include CSS rules appropriate for the device screen width and height</li>
</ul>
